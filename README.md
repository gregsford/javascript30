# javascript30 

This is my work on the JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos.
My method of learning and working on these courses is to code along with Wes, but pasuing the videos and trying to figure out and write the JS code myself to see whether or not I am able to get it to work properly before watching the tutorial.
I will journal how I felt and dealt with each course, any struggles I might have had, anything I felt comfortable or knew, or anything that is brand new to me.

<br>
My goal is to complete this course in consecutive 30 days.  
However if I feel I need more time to focus on the concepts of what is being coded, then I'll take more time as needed.
It is far more important to understand the code itself than to hastily run through projects while learning.

Day 1: JAVASCRIPT DRUM KIT (completed: )

I do not have a file for the Drum Kit.
While working on the code I was unable to get the .play() method to work on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, FireFox, or FireFox Developer Edition.
While looking up to figure out while it wouldn't play the sounds I came across a question about the very same project on StackOverflow where someone had said that Chromes recent update had made that play() method hard to execute.
I still haven't been able to try to figure out why it doesn't make a sound on the other platforms.  But I do plan to go back to that project and try to resolve the situation.

Day 2: CSS + JS CLOCK (completed: 8/17/2022)

This one I found to be a little bit easier.
In the oast few months I have coded along with 2 clock/time tutorials with Traversy Media (link to project here => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI) and Web Dev Simplified (link to project here => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki0XXrlKlHY).
So I had a basic idea of working with setInterval to 1000 and math operations to get the hands to rotate for the different times.
I did have a few struggles with getting the hands to connect to rotate, but it was mostly syntax errors(ie. leaving the "deg" at the end off of `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg), etc.`)
This was a fun project and I plan to do some more projects on my own with time and clocks in the future. 
I also made the second hand a dark shade on red, just for a better aesthetic feel.

Day 3: CSS VARIABLES (completed: 8/19/2022)

I liked doing this one because of being able to see how to connect the various areas and change them individually and as a group (the background color and the 'JS' color matching).  I had attempted to try to do this one ahead of watching the code that Wes used, but as soon as he started adding the variables into the style tags, I decided to follow and code along in case I missed something.  I have seen and worked with CSS variables before, but mainly using colors.  One issue that I did come across, but nothing major to break the code, was the mousemove event.  Looking at the console after applying it with the change event, it was not giving me any information.  However, being that the code did work, I wasn't too hung up on it.  I will go back and take a look and see if possibly my syntax was wrong or if there was something that I should've done instead.

Day 4: ARRAY CARDIO DAY 1 (completed: 8/20/2022)

I'm glad that this one showed more of how to use map, filter, sort.  I have gone through those many times but I still get confused by them simply because I do not use them often enough. I do need a lot more practice with these methods, but after completing this I think I'm going to try to do this "cardio" exercise again. Being that I need the practice not just with the coding but with the thought process, this should be good to try. On exercise 5, I did manage to come up with the response alone using a ternary operator based on the answer to exercise 3.  The only issue I had with the return was the -1 and 1.  I initially got them mixed up, so I need to practice that more to get a better understanding of how to correctly use them.  Overall I felt that this was a very helpful video and will be revisiting this one a bit to get better.
