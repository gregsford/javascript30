# javascript30 

This is my work on the JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos.
My method of learning and working on these courses is to code along with Wes, but pasuing the videos and trying to figure out and write the JS code myself to see whether or not I am able to get it to work properly before watching the tutorial.
I will journal how I felt and dealt with each course, any struggles I might have had, anything I felt comfortable or knew, or anything that is brand new to me.

<br>
My goal is to complete this course in consecutive 30 days.  
However if I feel I need more time to focus on the concepts of what is being coded, then I'll take more time as needed.
It is far more important to understand the code itself than to hastily run through projects while learning.

Day 1: JAVASCRIPT DRUM KIT (completed: 8/16/2022)

I do not have a file for the Drum Kit.
While working on the code I was unable to get the .play() method to work on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, FireFox, or FireFox Developer Edition.
While looking up to figure out while it wouldn't play the sounds I came across a question about the very same project on StackOverflow where someone had said that Chromes recent update had made that play() method hard to execute.
I still haven't been able to try to figure out why it doesn't make a sound on the other platforms.  But I do plan to go back to that project and try to resolve the situation.

Day 2: CSS + JS CLOCK (completed: 8/17/2022)
This one I found to be a little bit easier.
In the oast few months I have coded along with 2 clock/time tutorials with Traversy Media (link to project here => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI) and Web Dev Simplified (link to project here => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki0XXrlKlHY).
So I had a basic idea of working with setInterval to 1000 and math operations to get the hands to rotate for the different times.
I did have a few struggles with getting the hands to connect to rotate, but it was mostly syntax errors(ie. leaving the "deg" at the end off of `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg), etc.`)
This was a fun project and I plan to do some more projects on my own with time and clocks in the future. 
I also made the second hand a dark shade on red, just for a better aesthetic feel.
